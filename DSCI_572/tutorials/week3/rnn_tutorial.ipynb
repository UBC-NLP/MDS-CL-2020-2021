Word embeddings can be retrieved from the lookup table by providing a list of word index as input to the layer. We need to know what the input and the output of this layer look like.

We will be passing a batch of sentences to Pytorch and the max sequence length will be set to the length of the longest sentence (after tokenization) in that batch. The rest of sentences (shorter ones) will be padded with zeros. Now, do we need to explicitly provide the max sequence length to Pytorch? And how do we know the max seq length for each batch, if different batches have sequences of varying lengths and each batch is set to the max sent in that batch? Well, rest assured, we don't really need to worry about that. Pytorch will assign a max seq length for each batch.
