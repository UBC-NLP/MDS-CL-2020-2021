# DSCI 572 Supervised Learning II

An introduction to deep learning, with a focus on NLP problems and applications. Covers a number of deep learning methods.

Upon completion of this course students will be able to:


* *identify* the core principles of training and designing artificial neural networks
* *identify* the inherent ambiguity in natural language, and appreciate challenges
associated with teaching machines to understand and generate it
* *become* aware of the major deep learning methods developed for solving
NLP problems 
* *apply* deep learning methods to NLP problems in critical, creative, and novel ways
