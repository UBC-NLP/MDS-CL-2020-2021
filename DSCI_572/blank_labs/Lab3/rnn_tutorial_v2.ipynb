The rest of sentences (shorter ones) will be padded with zeros. Now, do we need to explicitly provide the max sequence length to Pytorch? And how do we know the max seq length for each batch, if different batches have sequences of varying lengths and each batch is set to the max sent in that batch? Well, rest assured, we don't really need to worry about that. Pytorch will assign a max seq length for each batch.
