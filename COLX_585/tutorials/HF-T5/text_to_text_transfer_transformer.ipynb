    "Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer (T5) model is an encoder-decoder model pretrained to fill in dropped-out spans of text (denoted by \\<M\\>) from documents in a large-scale unlabeled dataset. With T5, all NLP tasks can be reframed into a unified text-to-text format where the input and output are always text strings, in contrast to BERT-style models that can only output either a class label or a span of the input. T5's text-to-text framework allows us to use the same model, loss function, and hyperparameters on any NLP task, including machine translation, document summarization, question answering, and classification tasks (e.g., sentiment analysis). One can even apply T5 to regression tasks by training it to predict the string representation of a number instead of the number itself.\n",

    "In the above illustration, T5 is flexibly finetuned on several (diverse) supervised tasks:\n",
    "- **Machine Translation** - Translate sentence from English to German \n",
    "- **Sentence Acceptability (CoLA)** - Classify if a given sentence is grammatically and syntactically acceptable\n",
    "- **Semantic Textual Similarity (STS)** - Predict how similar two given sentences are (regression task)\n",
    "- **Summarization** - Summarize a given passage\n",

    "In this tutorial we will focus on finetuning T5 model on sentiment analysis task. Specifically, we focus on classifying the sentiment of the tweet. We make use of the dataset provided by ``SemEval-2016 Task 4 on Sentiment Analysis on Twitter`` (http://alt.qcri.org/semeval2016/task4/). We focus on the subtask A which is coined as **message polarity classification task**. In this task, given a tweet, we need to predict whether the tweet is of **positive, negative or neutral sentiment**. We have 6,000, 1,999 and 20,632 tweets in train, validation, and test set respectively. We have already preprocessed (tokenization, removing URLs, mentions, hashtags and so on) the tweets and placed it under ``data/sentiment-twitter-2016-task4`` folder in three files as ``train.tsv``, ``dev.tsv`` and ``test.tsv``. Some example tweets include:\n",
    "\n",
    "| class index | class name | tweet example |\n",
    "| ----------------- | ----------- |-------------|\n",
    "| 0  | Negative   | --MENTION-- --MENTION-- the reason i ask is because it may be the manufacturer's fault and they could help you |\n",
    "| 1  | Neutral | just ordered my ever tablet --MENTION-- surface pro --DIGIT-- ssd hopefully it works out for dev to replace my laptop |\n",
    "| 2  | Positive | dear --MENTION-- the newooffice for mac is great and all but no lync update c'mon |\n",
