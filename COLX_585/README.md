# COLX 585 Trends in Computational Linguistics

## Introduction                        

This goal of this course is two-fold. First, the course aims at introducing ``recent deep learning of NLP methods``. Second, the course will function as a context for ``further enhancing student knowledge of deep learing software engineering`` in a project-based fashion where students work on a problem of their choice for the whole course. 

__Slack Channel__: cl-585_trends


## Learning Outcomes
Upon completion of this course students will be able to:

* *identify, motivate, and propose* a research plan for an important, meaningful, and possibly socially relevant problem
* *become* aware of the major engineering and research efforts related to the chosen project and major approaches to solve it
* *apply* deep learning of NLP methods to provide solutions on the problem of choice
* *present*, clearly, their proposed solution in the form of an oral presentation, a written report, and code
* *develop* effective strategies for teamwork

## Project deadlines

This is an __project-based course__. You will work in assigned groups of three or four. You'll be evaluated as follows:

| Assessment       | Weight  | Deadline        | Location |
|------------------|---------|------------------|----------|
| Milestone 1: Project Proposal | 10%     | April 3, 12:59pm | On Github |
| Milestone 2: Progress Report 1 | 15%     |  April 10, 12:59pm | On Github |
| Milestone 3: Progress Report 2 | 15%     | April 17, 12:59pm | On Github |
| Milestone 4_a: Project Presentation | 5%   | April 21 TBD    | On [Zoom](https://ubc.zoom.us/j/62467194367?pwd=VEgveVZBNENncXo1R0lhUG03RHBUUT09)  |
| Milestone 4_b: Final Project | 25%   | April 25, 12:59pm    | On Github |
| Teamwork |  30% | April 28, 12:59pm  | On Github |

Note that for all but Teamwork, all students in the same group will receive the same grade. Students who get a failing grade on teamwork can get no better than a C in the course.

# Tutorials 
 
In Computational Linguistics it's expected to have a broad familiarity with the varied tasks and topics of the field, even though you may not be working on a specific topic in your day-to-day life. As a trends course, we thus aim to provide tutorials on a number of different techniques and topics, that may be useful to familiarize yourself with, even if you may not need them in your specific project. Our goal is to allow you to primarily investigate tools and techniques which will be useful to your project, while also secondarily allowing you to familiarize yourself with other techniques/tasks/tools you may encounter in the field.  

To restate: because people may be picking quite different projects, some of these tutorials may be more relevant to your group's project than others, and thus you will work with the TA team to identify your specific "need-to-knows" relevant to your project and which tutorials (or other resources) might meet these knowledge gaps. It is *encouraged*, but *not required* to watch all the videos/ do all the tutorials (and in fact may not be feasible to master all these techniques).  

(Note this will update as we add more tutorials/topics relevant to people's projects)
